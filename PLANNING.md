# Robot-Arm
#Iteration 1:  
#Purpose: Pick up cans on a desk space and throw them in the trash. It will scan for specifically red with the color sensor and pick it up and put it in the trash, which will be on the side of the desk.
#Materials: PLA, Screws, Wires, Breadboard, Arduino, Laser cut Resin, Servo. We will decide how much after we design. 
#Sucess: Pick up a can and move it to a set location.
#Safety: Can hit people or throw cans at them so we will add slow movements and rubber grips. \
#Rough Sketch:
